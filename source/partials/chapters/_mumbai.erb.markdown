# Mumbai Chapter

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and
loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the
ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers,
programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that
you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown
about the paper (because of HARD MATH!). Otherwise, just come, listen,
and discuss.


The **Mumbai Chapter** meets are coordinated through
our [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Mumbai/)
page. Join the group to stay updated.


Papers We Love has a
**[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/mumbai/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)**. Please

it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!
